Gameplay Overview:
Autumn Ambush is a top-down tower defense game in which the player places champions on the spaces allotted along the track to defeat monsters before they reach the exit. The player can choose to upgrade their champions or purchase a variety of new ones to aid them in surviving the never-ending waves of enemies.

- Enemies spawn on the left side of the map and follow the path to the exit on the right. The player needs to place towers to attack the spawned enemies using gold gained from the start of the game and enemies defeated
- Left click a tower type, then left click a pink space near the track to place the tower
- Once placed, a tower will automatically target the nearest enemy within a specified range
- Towers can be upgraded by left clicking the space they are placed on, then choosing an upgrade by left clicking an option above the tower
- Each tower can recieve three upgrades, and can be upgraded in any order
- Try to see how many waves you can defeat!
- Press space to start the game and begin placing towers

About Autumn Ambush:
This was a project for my Game Development class in spring of 2020, which took roughly 50 hours to complete and cost $0 to make thanks to free asset packs. However, if I were to add improvements to it now, I would consider adding health bars to the enemies for further clarity, and a new targeting system that allows towers to target either the first, last, or nearest enemy, similar to that in Bloons Tower Defense 5. I had a lot of fun making this one and it was a fresh addition to the projects that I had previously worked on :)
